    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey-patching is the process of inserting code during run-time, modifying the running instance, without modifying the original code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## WARNING:\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey-patching should be avoided in production. This is because the running instance of software should be explicit -- reflected by what is on disk. Monkey patching also makes assumptions of what is on disk and the running state. If that software changes, the patch may not work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications during development\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey-patching with respect to Data Science workflows is useful when we want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Dive deeper with running objects, especially library objects.** We may want to understand a particular object's method in more detail. While we can see the code using the `inspect` module, we may want to log activity to see internal workings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **Accelerate iterative development.** During the enhancement of an object's method, the typical flow is to make a code change, reinstantiate the object, then call the object's method, and repeat as necessary. For many objects, this is not problematic, but say you have a model that takes time to train. It can be quite tedious to retrain with each instantiation. As well, if the object is in Python module that we are updating, we may need to restart the Python kernel to reimport the module. This may also mean reloading large data sources, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at these two scenarios, but first, let's look at a basic template.\n",

This allows us to fix bugs, make modifications, or add attributes to an existing model without having to retrain it to utilize the code changes. Ultimately, when we are finished, we should retrain the model completely. But this demo is to show how we can do development on a trained model.\n",
